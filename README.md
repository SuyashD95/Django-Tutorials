# Django-Tutorials

## This repository contains all the tutorial projects that I have worked on, to learn ***Django*** (a web framework written in Python).

### **DISCLAIMER**: Most of the code snippets or web apps that are part of this repo are either **copied (with some minor modifications) or based on tutorials** created by some fantastic individuals and organizations.
---
There are several reasons behind my decision to create a separate repository (instead of forking) to save the tutorial projects:

* The primary reason is for me, to use these projects as a reference point; to come back to the repo and observe how much I have progressed in the world of Django.
* Some of the tutorials doesn't have a repository and I would like to keep all of my tutorial projects (for a particular subject/framework) in one place instead of distributing them across multiple repositories.

**He is, in my humble opinion, the best Python instructor on YouTube. His easy-to-understand explanations, structure of his tutorial videos along with the range of topics that he covers on his channel means there is something for everyone on his channel.**
 
*If you are a Python developer or an enthusiast, I wholeheartedly **recommend** him to everyone and urge you to go to his channel... I am sure that you will not be disappointed.*

**Now, what makes his *Django* series so special, is the fact that he covers the absolute essentials that someone might require to start their journey in Django...**

*He introduces key concepts in a gradual manner without overwhelming the learner... But, his videos are dense with information so I would advise all potential viewers to go section-by-section (instead of jumping from watching one video to another).*

*His tutorial series is the only good one that I have seen so far, that doesn't only cover how to build some basic test apps but also goes through the process of deploying your web app to a Linux server, getting a SSL/TLS certificate, or using Amazon AWS S3.*
