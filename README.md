# Django-Tutorials

## This repository contains all the tutorial projects that I have worked on, to learn ***Django*** (a web framework written in Python).

### **DISCLAIMER**: Most of the code snippets or web apps that are part of this repo are either **copied (with some minor modifications) or based on tutorials** created by some fantastic individuals and organizations.
---
There are several reasons behind my decision to create a separate repository (instead of forking) to save the tutorial projects:

* The primary reason is for me, to use these projects as a reference point; to come back to the repo and observe how much I have progressed in the world of Django.
* Some of the tutorials doesn't have a repository and I would like to keep all of my tutorial projects (for a particular subject/framework) in one place instead of distributing them across multiple repositories.

**He is, in my humble opinion, the best Python instructor on YouTube. His easy-to-understand explanations, structure of his tutorial videos along with the range of topics that he covers on his channel means there is something for everyone on his channel.**
 
*If you are a Python developer or an enthusiast, I wholeheartedly **recommend** him to everyone and urge you to go to his channel... I am sure that you will not be disappointed.*

**Now, what makes his *Django* series so special, is the fact that he covers the absolute essentials that someone might require to start their journey in Django...**

*He introduces key concepts in a gradual manner without overwhelming the learner... But, his videos are dense with information so I would advise all potential viewers to go section-by-section (instead of jumping from watching one video to another).*

*His tutorial series is the only good one that I have seen so far, that doesn't only cover how to build some basic test apps but also goes through the process of deploying your web app to a Linux server, getting a SSL/TLS certificate, or using Amazon AWS S3.*

**No discussion of tutorials on Django can ever be completed without the mention of the excellent tutorial given on the Django's official site (djangoproject.com).**

*The tutorial covers all the fundamental concepts that one needs to know, to get start building some basic web apps with Django... It also touches on topics like using the provided test framework in Django to test web apps as well as some niche topics like customizing the administrator's page.*

**But, what makes this tutorial unique and stand out from the rest of the tutorials on the Internet (apart from the fact that it is literally developed by the creators of Django), is the fact that it doesn't only tell how-to-do things in Django but also gives a glimpse to the learner about the *PHILOSOPHY* behind the various key concepts/constructs present in the framework.**

***Django is a macro framework which means that it comes with batteries included** and hence, it is very important to understand on how the fundamental mechanisms work, to fully utilize the power of the framework. A lack of understanding could easily lead an aspiring learner to get overwhelmed and give up on the framework without actually realizing its true potential.*

*Another reason why I **highly recommend** this tutorial to everyone, is because it allows people **an opportunity to explore the well-written documentation** provided by the team behind Django.*

*One another advantage of doing tutorials directly from Django's official site is to ensure that **it will always remain up-to-date with the latest developments in the framework** and hence, the chances of it losing relevance over time are next to impossible. You can always be rest assured that whatever you learnt from the tutorials will always remain relevant.*
